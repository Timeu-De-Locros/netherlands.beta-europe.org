The Montesquieu Institute is a multidisciplinary institute at the intersection of democracy, politics and parliamentary decision-making in the Netherlands and Europe. That also organises the Model European Parliament in the Netherlands, a simulation of the EP for High School students.

We work together with other scientific institutions in the Netherlands and Europe and strive to bring the available knowledge in this field within reach of civil servants, administrators, journalists, politicians, scientists and interested citizens in a timely and manageable manner.
