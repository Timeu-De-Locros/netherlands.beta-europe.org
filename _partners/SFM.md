Student Forum Maastricht (SFM) is an annual international academic conference bringing together students and professionals to discuss Europe-related topics.

Their aim is to provide a platform where interested students can exchange ideas and engage in fruitful discussions. SFM offers a successful and productive way to put issues of concern and challenges for the European Union into a more practical context.

In different workshops, students can apply their knowledge and profit from the experience of professionals coming from an academic, political or economic background. The interdisciplinary approach creates the opportunity to gain insights from various fields. At the end of the conference, the proposals drafted by the working groups will be submitted to the European Commission
