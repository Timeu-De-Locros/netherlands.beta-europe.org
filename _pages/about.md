Bringing Europeans Together Association Netherlands (BETA Netherlands) is a non-profit national youth association founded in June 2018 by a group of young, capable and ambitious individuals who had the ultimate goal of bringing Model European Union simulations to Netherlands, the birthplace of democratic debate. BETA Netherlands is also the official Dutch branch of the European federal association based in Brussels, Bringing Europeans Together Association Europe (BETA Europe).

**Our Goals**

*  To engage, educate and empower youth through its activities, namely our flagship annual event, Model European Union The Hague (MEU The Hague)
* To support youth initiatives in Netherlands which fall in the sphere of debate, policy-making and European integration

**Our Mission**

Operating as a non-profit association founded in Netherlands, BETA Netherlands also shares the mission and European values of BETA Europe and works closely with them to:

* Strengthen the democratic European civil society
* Raise awareness on pressing political issues, on local, regional, European and international levels

**MEU The Hague**



 The flagship project of BETA Netherlands is Model European Union The Hague (MEU The Hague) which is scheduled to premiere in late 2019. The project aims to promote knowledge of the decision-making process, representing the way new EU legislation comes to force while fostering mutual understanding and cooperation through debate and dialogue amidst youth within Netherlands and Europe.
