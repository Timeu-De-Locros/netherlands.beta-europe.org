Since members of BETA Netherlands are also members of BETA Europe a.i.s.b.l. the data collected can also be shared with this association. Data might also be shared with third parties that provide us with our online web tools (G-suite) and financial administration. We will only share data with third parties we have a Data Protection Agreement with. Processing is done in a GDPR compliant way.  Data will not be saved for longer than necessary to fullfill the goals the data is collected for. By filling in this form you accept the privacy policy described above.
